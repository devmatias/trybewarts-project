# Trybewarts-Project

> Status: Developing ⚠️

### It is a website planned by me together with the Trybe course, where I create a form to gather information about the students of a fictional school based on Harry Potter Movies.

## Some info that's asked in the form is:

+ first name and last name
+ email
+ student's house
+ student's family
+ student's subjects
+ avaliation about the school
+ observations about the school
+ agreement about the usage of the information

Also that, has a user validation with this fields:

+ email
+ password

## The main point of this project is to evaluate my growth in my journey as a Web Developer. This is a basic project using some tecnologies as:

 + HTML
 + CSS
 + JavaScript
 + Bootstrap
 
 ### In HTML, I try to utilize appropriate tags to make my project readable and functional. In CSS, I try to explore the usage of Flex Box, Media Queries and other tools. In JavaScript, I try to implement validations, manipulate data from the form to another container and other features.
